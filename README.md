# HarvardX-MITx-Person-Course-Prediction

### Goal:
Analyze student data to try to predict whether a student received a certification (completed) a course.

### Description
This dataset is at the level of one row per-person, per-course. So, for example, if one individual enrolled in three MITx or HarvardX courses during the period covered by the dataset (for this release, Fall 2012, Spring 2013, and Summer 2013), that person would have three rows associated with their userID.
The dataset includes both administrative variables and variables generated from user-provided data. 
For a detailed description of the variables included in the de-identified dataset, please see the data dictionary excel file.
